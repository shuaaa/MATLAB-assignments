# MATLAB-assignments
The repository is to keep track of my Masters Degree journey. MSc. Business Analytics from the Lappenranta university of Technology, Finland.
All coding works related to the studies will be tracked here. 
The codes will be made mostly in Matlab, and sometimes in Python, R and C/C++ depending specific needs and sentiments.
Majority of these codes are belated, however i will send them to git and keep them updated from time.
